Deploying this way takes several steps: creating a deployment package, transferring it to the desired environment, and restarting the app. Each step can take several minutes after which you have to check back to see if you can progress further.\nYou’ll save a lot of time and frustration by automating this process. In this blog post, I’ll go over my automated deployment pipeline using Postman. The Postman collection contains several services for the Mendix API. It has services to build, transport, and deploy new packages. After setting it up, you’ll be able to use the Postman Collection Runner to run these requests in sequence and deploy with a single press of a button!\nFind the finished collection here.\nIt includes a folder for new deployments and a folder to redeploy the last package. The latter can be used to transport a package from one environment to the other, i.e. from Test to Acceptance. You can start the Collection Runner on one of the folders depending on your use case.\nStep 1: Preparing the environment Create a new Postman Collection. We use that to store our requests and variables.\nBefore getting started on requests, we need the proper credentials for the Deploy API. We’ll need tokens for both the Deploy API and the App Repository API.\nFollow the steps described in both below doc pages to set up your API credentials.\nDeploy API App Repository API Store the credentials in your Collection Variables as MendixUsername, MendixApiKey and MendixPersonalAccessToken.\nStep 2: Test the connection and retrieve the project App ID Once the connection is working, we’ll need the app’s identifiers. We can retrieve our apps using the following API call. Store the returned AppID and ProjectID as a variable.\nGET https://deploy.mendix.com/api/1/apps Mendix-Username: {{MendixUsername}} Mendix-ApiKey: {{MendixApiKey}} Store the AppID and ProjectID in Environment Variables if you work on multiple Mendix apps. Select the right environment before running to deploy different apps each time!\nLastly, store the desired branch that you want to deploy as a variable. All preparation is now done and your variables should look like this:\nStep 3: Retrieve the latest revision Once we have the App ID and Project ID stored in our global variables, we can use them to perform our API calls. The first step is to retrieve the latest revision from the App Repository API. We also need to send our App Repository API credentials in the headers.\nGET https://repository.api.mendix.com/v1/repositories/{{ProjectID}}/branches/{{branch}}/commits Authorization: MxToken {{MendixPersonalAccessToken}} Once we receive a response, we have to store part of it to reuse it in subsequent requests. I chose to store them as collection variables. To do so, we can run a test to store a collection variable after a successful response:\nconst response = pm.response.json(); const latestRevision = response.items[0].id; pm.test(\u0026quot;Has latest revision\u0026quot;, () =\u0026gt; { pm.expect(latestRevision).to.not.be.undefined; pm.collectionVariables.set(\u0026quot;latestRevision\u0026quot;, latestRevision); }); Step 4: Retrieve the current environment package The Deploy API expects a version number to be included upon package creation. The most logical approach is to retrieve the package that is currently running and add a minor version to that. In order to do so, first set an environment variable as the name of the environment you want to deploy, then execute the following request:\nGET https://deploy.mendix.com/api/1/apps/{{AppID}}/packages Mendix-Username: {{MendixUsername}} Mendix-ApiKey: {{MendixApiKey}} From here on out, you’ll need to include the authentication headers every time. Make sure to include both Mendix-Username and Mendix-ApiKey for each request!\nThen, store the version as a collection variable using a test script:\nconst response = pm.response.json(); const version = response.Version; pm.test(\u0026quot;Received current package version\u0026quot;, () =\u0026gt; { pm.expect(version).to.not.be.undefined; pm.collectionVariables.set(\u0026quot;version\u0026quot;, version); }); Step 5: Create a new package Once we have the version stored, we can start creating a new package. Before we send the request, we can run a Pre-Request script to calculate the version:\nlet version = pm.collectionVariables.get(\u0026quot;version\u0026quot;); if(version) { version.lastIndexOf(\u0026quot;.\u0026quot;); let packageVersion = version.substring(0,version.lastIndexOf(\u0026quot;.\u0026quot;)); let minorVersion = packageVersion.substring(packageVersion.lastIndexOf(\u0026quot;.\u0026quot;) + 1, version.length); let majorVersion = packageVersion.substring(0, packageVersion.lastIndexOf(\u0026quot;.\u0026quot;)); let newMinorVersion = parseInt(minorVersion) + 1; pm.collectionVariables.set(\u0026quot;newVersion\u0026quot;, majorVersion + \u0026quot;.\u0026quot; + newMinorVersion); } else { pm.collectionVariables.set(\u0026quot;newVersion\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;0.0.0\u0026quot;); } Then, we can send a request to start the package build:\nPOST https://deploy.mendix.com/api/1/apps/{{AppID}}/packages { \u0026quot;Branch\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;trunk\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Revision\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;{{latestRevision}}\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Version\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;{{newVersion}}\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Description\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;New minor version deployed from Postman\u0026quot; } And store the returned package ID for later use in a test script:\nconst response = pm.response.json(); const packageID = response.PackageId; pm.test(\u0026quot;Received package ID\u0026quot;, () =\u0026gt; { pm.expect(packageID).to.not.be.undefined; pm.collectionVariables.set(\u0026quot;packageID\u0026quot;, packageID); }); Step 6: Check the package build status The package is now building asynchronously on the Mendix Cloud. In order to proceed, we must wait for the package to be done. We’ll keep sending a request every minute or so until the package is done:\nGET https://deploy.mendix.com/api/1/apps/{{AppID}}/packages/{{packageID}} We can have Postman retry the request after a minute if the test case fails:\nconst response = pm.response.json(); pm.test(\u0026quot;Build succeeded\u0026quot;, function () { pm.expect(response.Status).to.equal(\u0026quot;Succeeded\u0026quot;); }); if (response.Status !== \u0026quot;Succeeded\u0026quot;) { console.log(\u0026quot;Package is still building...\u0026quot;); if(response.Status === \u0026quot;Failed\u0026quot;) { return false; } else { setTimeout(() =\u0026gt; {}, 60000); // wait for 1 minute before retrying postman.setNextRequest(pm.info.requestId); // retry the current request } Step 7: Transport the package Once the package is done, we can transport it to the environment. Luckily this is a synchronous action so we don’t have to include any timeouts here.\nPOST https://deploy.mendix.com/api/1/apps/{{AppID}}/environments/{{environment}}/transport { \u0026quot;PackageId\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;{{packageID}}\u0026quot; } Step 8: Stop the environment The final steps are about rebooting the environment so the new package is activated.\nPOST https://deploy.mendix.com/api/1/apps/{{AppID}}/environments/{{environment}}/stop Step 9: Start the environment After stopping the environment, we can start it up again.\nPOST https://deploy.mendix.com/api/1/apps/{{AppID}}/environments/{{environment}}/start We’ll store the Job ID in the response for later use:\nconst response = pm.response.json(); pm.test(\u0026quot;Received JobId\u0026quot;, function () { let jobId = response.JobId; pm.expect(jobId).to.not.be.undefined; pm.collectionVariables.set(\u0026quot;JobID\u0026quot;, jobId); }); Step 10: Check start status (optional) The request to start the environment is asynchronous again. Optionally, we can send another request using timeouts to keep checking for the start status.\nGET https://deploy.mendix.com/api/1/apps/{{AppID}}/environments/{{environment}}/start/{{JobID}} Keep checking the status using the Postman tests:\nconst response = pm.response.json(); if (response.Status === \u0026quot;Starting\u0026quot;) { console.log(\u0026quot;Environment is starting...\u0026quot;); setTimeout(() =\u0026gt; {}, 60000); postman.setNextRequest(pm.info.requestId); } pm.test(\u0026quot;Environment has started\u0026quot;, function () { pm.expect(response.Status).to.equal(\u0026quot;Started\u0026quot;); }); Once the environment has started, the collection run will finish and your new package will be available online.\nYou can now use the Postman Collection Runner to run all the requests in order. This automatically deploys a new package from the latest revision in your selected branch. If anything needs to be fixed as expected, refer to the extensive Mendix documentation available, or leave a comment below!\nNext steps This blog post is meant to give you an idea of what is possible using the available Mendix API services. From here on out, you can expand the functionality as necessary. For my project, I have an integration with the Slack API sending messages when I start and finish a deployment to notify the team. You can send e-mails on deployments, you can integrate the service with a tool like Jenkins for a scheduled deployment. Anything is possible from here on out! I hope this blog post saves you some time in the future and perhaps inspires you to explore new automation capabilities.\n","permalink":"https://maismaus.github.io/blog/quick-and-easy-deployments-using-postman/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf your app runs in the Mendix cloud you are probably using the Mendix Developer Portal to deploy your application.

Mendix Studio Pro is a great piece of software to build apps with, but there are a plethora of other tools that can help you build apps more efficiently than ever before. In this article, I go over my recommendations for must-have tools for everyday use in Mendix development.\n1. Use Prettier for automatic file formatting If you have experience writing custom styling, you are probably familiar with CSS indentation formatting. Did you know there are easy ways to automate this? I use the Visual Studio Code extension Prettier to automatically format my SCSS whenever I save a file.\nYou can even customize the formatting rules on a per-project basis, using a Prettier configuration file! This way, you can ensure that everyone on your team uses the same formatting.\n2. Extend Mendix Version Control by installing TortoiseSVN Mendix uses Subversion (SVN) for version management. Most of the things you need for this are included under the Version Control menu item in Studio Pro, but you can download TortoiseSVN to get some additional functionalities.\nWith TortoiseSVN, you can:\nUpdate to a specific revision, for instance, to compare changes between commits. Rename and archive branches. Resolve merge issues that occurred outside of Studio Pro. Update and commit without having to open Studio Pro. Add items to the ignore list, preventing merge conflicts for compiled files. Make sure you check which TortoiseSVN version you need for your Studio Pro version.\n3. Enhance your browser with bookmarklets Mendix offers a JavaScript API that you can use to your advantage. Most modern browsers offer the option to save JavaScript snippets in your bookmarks called bookmarklets.\nBookmarking a JavaScript function allows you to call it with a single mouse click directly from your browser. The possibilities are endless: logging in, opening a page, executing a microflow… You can bookmark any function that you use regularly during app development.\nLog out of any Mendix application instantly by clicking a bookmark on your toolbar javascript:(function()%7Bmx.logout()%3B%7D)()%3B\nI use this bookmarklet maker to generate bookmarklets from my JavaScript snippets.\n4. Squeeze more efficiency out of Windows using PowerToys If you’ve ever used a MacBook before, I’m sure you miss the Spotlight feature after switching to Windows. Did you know Microsoft offers this — and more — with PowerToys? For instance, it adds functionality in File Explorer to preview .svg and .md files, a right-click image resizer, and a nifty color picker. A must-have for anyone using Windows on a daily basis!\n5. Automate your installation process with Chocolatey Again, if you used a MacBook in the past, you’ve probably heard of Homebrew. There is a Windows equivalent called Chocolatey. Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows that allows you to search for and install software right from the command prompt.\nTo illustrate, let me give you an example. I’m sure you are familiar with the traditional method of installing new software. It goes something like this:\nOpen browser Search for software Load the website Navigate to the download page Find the correct version Download installer Open the installer Go through the installation wizard Done With Chocolatey, you can:\nOpen command prompt Enter choco install PowerToys -y Done Sounds good? That’s because it is! Now let’s get Mendix Studio Pro available in Chocolatey by upvoting my idea on the forum.\n6. Use the built-in Windows Snipping Tool to capture parts of your screen Got a problem that you want to visualize? Use the Snipping Tool to capture parts of your screen in a screenshot. That way, you can keep your screenshots focused on the exact item that you want to share instead of sharing your entire screen. Simply press ⊞ Win + Shift + S and drag to select the part of the screen you want to capture.\n7. Improve your integration testing with Postman One of Mendix’s strengths is its ability to integrate with many other systems. Integrations are a key part of many Mendix applications. However, troubleshooting a connection from within Mendix is often a hassle because of the configuration required to set it up. You can use Postman instead to perform web service calls to and from Mendix.\nPostman also offers a collection runner, where you can configure a number of web service requests in a specific order. You can use this on top of unit tests for test automation:\nI’m working on a blogpost about automated Mendixcloud deployments from Postman. Follow me on LinkedIn to be the first to hear about it!\n8. Run a local mail server using FakeSMTP Configuring an external e-mail server to work locally can be a nuisance. You might not have an internet connection, configuration settings change or you don’t want to have to reconfigure the e-mail server every time you switch databases locally. For these scenarios, FakeSMTP is a perfect solution. This lightweight Java package will run a local e-mail server that you can connect to in seconds. Because it is written in Java, you can use it on any operating system too!\n9. Use Fiddler to analyze incoming and outgoing traffic If you want to have more insight into what data is coming in and going out, Fiddler is a must-have tool. You can route all internet traffic through Fiddler to analyze in detail what requests are being made between your computer and external servers. Make sure to configure the Fiddler port as a proxy in your Mendix project settings so all traffic is properly routed through it!\n10. Slack Did you know there is an entire Mendix community available on Slack? This active community can help you out with problems. Find the Mendix Slack community here!\n","permalink":"https://maismaus.github.io/blog/10-essential-tools-for-Mendix-development/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eNo matter what you do for a living, making sure you have the right tools for the job is essential for any working professional.

Maybe you’ve flirted with coding in the past, or hacked your way through a few websites, and generally, you have an affinity with modern tech. Or perhaps you are a psych student who enjoyed working with statistics, and you’re starting to realize that you have to pay those bills eventually.\nSooner or later, you’ll need to find yourself one of those “tech jobs”.\nBefore I started working as a Mendix developer I had serious doubts about my future career path. I liked writing code, but I didn’t see myself doing that all day, every day. But I did like building things. I like looking back at a days’ work and seeing the results. That’s what building software is. I didn’t know about Low-code until I was approached by my previous employer who explained the Mendix platform to me.\nAs a Mendix developer, you build digital applications without writing traditional code. Instead, you’re building applications using prebuilt parts. You design pieces of logic called microflows, which Mendix translates into things computers can understand once you launch the app. A microflow looks like a traditional workflow diagram. It has a start and an end and executes the pieces of logic in between.\nBecause the pieces are prebuilt and ready to use, you can develop logic up to ten times faster than traditional coding methods. And because the learning curve is much less steep than coding, it’s a lot easier to get into. You don’t need a computer science degree to work with Low-code technologies. In fact, most Mendix developers come from completely different academic fields. I’ve had the pleasure of working with Mendix developers with diverse academic backgrounds such as biomedical science, psychology, and industrial engineering. And while the IT sector continues to be a male-dominated world, this stereotype doesn’t hold up as much in Low-code. Women even outnumbered the men in my team at one point.\nThis diversity in backgrounds leads to Low-code developers often taking on more diverse responsibilities. It is no coincidence that Low-code developers are often referred to as business engineers, although I still prefer to refer to us as developers. A business engineer forms a hybrid between a business administration expert and a software engineer. It means they can understand and translate business needs into software requirements, but also transform those requirements into real software. Most of your day is usually spent developing, but you can be involved in many more parts of the software development process. At my previous employer, it was no exception that business engineers were involved in other activities such as sales and user experience (UX) design.\nEven within Mendix, you can choose to expand into different territories. You can decide to focus on front-end development by learning everything there is to know about styling or you can become an expert back-end developer integrating your system with other systems. You can also choose to dive deeper into the Mendix core by learning about Java development. Most Mendix developers have specific expertise that they are most interested in, but you’ll most likely work on all those areas at some point. Traditional software engineers don’t often get this luxury.\nAll this means you have a lot of options for career growth. You could start as a basic Mendix developer but later choose to expand into other territories. If you find that you have a knack for selling the platform, you can do that alongside your main gig. If you feel comfortable designing applications before building them, there’s usually an opening to do so.\nA lot of that flexibility also comes down to companies supporting your preferences. Most companies active in Low-code are great places to work. They have to be, in order to attract and retain the right people. If you haven’t noticed, Low-code is booming and so are job openings. Finding new business engineers is challenging and companies want to keep employees happy and satisfied. It also means that if you choose to work in Low-code, you’ll be almost certain of having a job for the next decade or so. And while something like job security sounds like the dullest topic to talk about at first, the feeling that you can find a job anywhere is truly comforting.\nIf you want to work as a Mendix developer you have a number of options. If you choose to work in consultancy, you’ll have the opportunity to work on projects for different companies. It’s a great way to gain professional experience in different environments. In the past four years, I worked for companies of all shapes and sizes in fields such as finance, insurance, health, and government. If you are unsure what you want for your career, working in consultancy is the perfect way to explore your options.\nAlternatively, you can choose to work for a company that uses Mendix apps directly. Or you can choose to apply for a job at Mendix itself. As I don’t have hands-on experience with either, I don’t feel qualified to talk about those options, but I’ve heard positive stories about both.\nThe freedom and growth opportunities that you get as a Mendix developer are great. And you can even decide to move into freelancing, as I recently did. Whatever you decide, as a Mendix developer you’ll always have the satisfaction of building amazing digital applications with real-world impact.\nThis blog post reflects my personal beliefs only. It was not written in conjunction with Mendix or my previous employer Finaps. The first version of this article was already published during my time there. This updated article reflects my latest thoughts on the subject.\n","permalink":"https://maismaus.github.io/blog/why-working-as-a-mendix-developer-is-great/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHere’s the deal\u003c/em\u003e — you’re in your twenties, freshly graduated from college.

Ik had verschillende redenen om als zelfstandige te willen beginnen. Voornamelijk de vrijheid van het freelancen sprak mij aan. Over de autonomie beschikken om te mogen bepalen hoe veel vakantie je opneemt, welke opdracht je aanneemt en welke richting je op wilt bewegen als professional. Maar er speelden ook veel onzekerheden: hoe kom ik aan een opdracht en hoe is het om geen directe collega\u0026rsquo;s te hebben.\nIk krijg regelmatig de vraag hoe het zetten van de stap mij is bevallen. Daarom heb ik mijn gedachten in deze blogpost opgeschreven. Ik structureer mijn bevindingen als de overpeinzingen die ik had voordat ik begon en die ik nu achteraf vanuit mijn ervaring bespreek. Onderaan vind je ook nog een lijstje van praktische to-dos. Ik werk zelf als low-code Mendix ontwikkelaar, maar veel van deze bevindingen gelden ook voor ontwikkelaars in andere technologieën.\n🇬🇧 Experiences may vary. My only experience so far has been in the Dutch market as a native Dutch speaker. Therefore, I wrote this post exclusively in Dutch.\nAls freelancer moet je zelf aan opdrachten komen Ik begin met het grootste twijfelpunt voor de meeste mensen (inclusief ikzelf) om de stap te zetten: het vinden van een opdracht. Voor mensen in loondienst is dit vaak het belangrijkste punt dat de grootste twijfel oplevert.\nVoor mij was dit uiteindelijk zo gepiept. Zodra ik serieus op zoek ging kwam er toevallig een leuke opdracht voorbij op freelance.nl waar ik op reageerde en direct aan de slag kon. Er zijn veel bedrijven die op zoek zijn naar tijdelijke krachten. Ze zoeken bijvoorbeeld iemand op projectbasis of ze kunnen niemand vinden voor een baan in loondienst en zetten daarom een freelancer in. Zodra je je in dat wereldje gaat oriënteren ontdek je vanzelf alle mogelijkheden. Er is een enorme vraag naar ervaren ontwikkelaars en er is dus een ruim aanbod aan projecten om uit te kiezen. Maar uiteraard geldt: your mileage may vary. Het is natuurlijk afhankelijk van je eigen initiatief, ervaring en locatie.\nJe kunt het ook omdraaien. Je mag je eigen opdrachten uitkiezen. Je bent niet afhankelijk van de salesafdeling van het bedrijf waar je werkt, maar je mag zelf kiezen wat je belangrijk vindt in een opdracht. De reisafstand, de grootte van het bedrijf of de mensen die er rondlopen. Vaak wordt er door werkgevers wel enige rekening mee gehouden, maar soms is er geen andere opdracht beschikbaar. Dan zal je toch een vervelende opdracht moeten doen. De werkgever heeft dan ook het recht om dat van je te eisen. Zint een opdracht als freelancer je niet? Dan stap je gewoon op.\nPortalen Afhankelijk van de technologie waar je mee werkt vind je opdrachten op verschillende portalen. Voor Mendix vind je het meeste op freelance.nl, en via je netwerk op LinkedIn. Op Headfirst verschijnen de meeste overheidsopdrachten. Ik gebruik dit topic om op de hoogte te blijven van de reuring onder gelijkgezinden. In de eerste post vind je uitgebreide informatie over het starten als zelfstandige.\nTussenpartijen Door tussenpartijen word ik veel benaderd voor projecten. Ik heb wisselende ervaringen met recruiters. Sommigen doen erg hun best en denken met je mee. Anderen hebben je LinkedIn profiel niet eens bekeken voordat ze je een bericht sturen. Ik probeer het zelf zonder tussenpartij als een recruiter te regelen. Ik heb begrepen dat je voor sommige opdrachten er niet onderuit komt. Bij overheden is het vaak een vereiste om een contract via een broker te regelen vanwege de aanbestedingsregels. Zelf heb ik daar geen ervaring mee en heb ik een contract direct bij de klant. Tussenpartijen snoepen altijd een deel van je uurtarief af. Dit kan erg varieren van 30% (zoals in een midlance constructie) tot 3 euro per uur (via Headfirst). Ik vind het zelf hoe dan ook erg zonde van het geld gezien de hoeveelheid werk die ze over het algemeen voor je verrichten.\nAls freelancer moet je zelf je administratie doen Eigenlijk vond ik dit al met al tegenvallen. Je kunt dit op verschillende manieren aanpakken. Ik heb graag mijn zaken goed op orde, maar daar komt veel uitzoekwerk bij kijken. Je moet weten hoe de belastingen werken, hoe je je facturen verwerkt en hoe je je uren goed registreert. Je moet weten wat het urencriterium is en wat het voor je betekent. Je moet weten hoe je een auto op de zaak zet, en of het handiger is om je auto privé te rijden en de kilometers zakelijk te declareren. Daarnaast moet je ook verzekeringen regelen, over je pensioen nadenken, nadenken over arbeidsongeschiktheid, enzovoort. Vervolgens moet je ook weten hoe je dit alles correct registreert in je administratie.\nZo sloot ik onlangs een abonnement voor Adobe CC af, maar op de factuur stond dat de BTW naar mij verlegd was. Vervolgens ben ik een tijd bezig geweest met uitzoeken wat BTW verleggen betekent, en hoe ik dat correct verwerk in mijn administratie.\nDaar moet bij gezegd worden dat een goed boekhoudprogramma je al veel werk uit handen neemt. Ik gebruik zelf MoneyMonk waar ik erg tevreden over ben. Als je deze link gebruikt krijg je het eerste jaar 50% korting (en ik een cadeaubon van 25 euro). Je kunt ook een boekhouder nemen, hoewel ik daar zelf niet voor gekozen heb. Wel heb ik binnenkort een eenmalig gesprek met een boekhouder om het boekjaar 2021 door te nemen.\nHet grootste deel van het werk is eenmalig uitzoekwerk. Als vervolgens alles loopt, dan loopt het. Iedere maand ben ik tien minuten bezig mijn uren te registreren en mijn facturen in mijn boekhoudprogramma te zetten.\nAls freelancer moet je zelf je tarief bepalen Een lastig punt waar vaak geheimzinnig over gedaan wordt. Hoe dan ook kan ik je garanderen dat je als freelancer meer kunt verdienen dan bij een detacheerder. Bij een detacheerder moeten immers meer mensen dan jijzelf betaald worden van jouw uurtarief. Wel liggen uurtarieven van detacheerders over het algemeen iets hoger dan voor zelfstandigen. Je kunt dus niet je huidige uurtarief in loondienst vragen als je start als zelfstandige. Bedrijven betalen het hogere tarief soms liever omdat ze dan meer zekerheid hebben dat er een alternatief ingebracht kan worden bij uitval. Als een zelfstandige uitvalt, is er niet iemand anders die de taken kan overnemen.\nWat mij betreft is dit overigens een valse zekerheid. Je kunt sowieso niet iemand die uitvalt zomaar 1-op-1 vervangen, omdat er altijd ervaring wegvalt. En detacheerders hebben meestal niet mensen op de bank zitten, klaar om iemand te vervangen.\nHet uurtarief voor een zelfstandige Mendix ontwikkelaar ligt, afhankelijk van de rol en je ervaring, tussen de 65 en 125 euro.\nAls freelancer heb je minder zekerheid Dit is voor veel mensen een belangrijk twijfelpunt om de stap naar freelancen te maken. Ik moet hierbij zeggen dat dit voor mij geen groot punt was. Ik had een reserve opgebouwd om een periode zonder opdracht te kunnen overbruggen en omdat ik op goede voet wegging bij mijn werkgever was ik daar altijd welkom om terug te keren.\nAls je een vast contract hebt, kan een werkgever je niet zomaar ontslaan. Je hebt dus een zekere garantie dat iedere maand het salaris op je rekening staat. Als freelancer zijn je inkomsten grilliger: als je op vakantie gaat verdien je minder en je weet nooit zeker wanneer de factuur betaald wordt en het geld op je rekening staat.\nMijn mening is dat zo lang je ervoor zorgt dat je voldoende buffer hebt om periodes zonder salaris te overbruggen, je ruim voldoende zekerheid hebt. En omdat je uurtarief hoger is dan je salaris in loondienst, is het opbouwen van voldoende buffer des te makkelijker.\nAls freelancer moet je voldoende vaardigheid bezitten Over het algemeen wordt er van een freelancer een bepaalde mate van zelfstandigheid verwacht. Bedrijven huren een freelancer in met de verwachting dat die snel up and running zal zijn. Omdat je niet in dienstverband zit gaat de opdrachtgever niet in je investeren zoals een traditionele werkgever dat doet. Je bent zelf verantwoordelijk voor je ontwikkeling. Maar je hebt dus ook geen bila\u0026rsquo;s en andere verplichtingen waar veel freelancers een hekel aan hebben.\nIn mijn ervaring geeft het meer voldoening om aan je eigen ontwikkeling te werken als freelancer. In loondienst krijg je vaak van hogerhand doelen opgelegd, waar je niet per definitie achter staat. Of misschien wel achter het idee, maar niet achter de uitvoering. Als je in loondienst iets gaafs doet, draag je bij aan de prestige van het bedrijf. Als freelancer draag je bij aan je eigen \u0026lsquo;merk\u0026rsquo;. Dat geeft mij meer voldoening.\nDe meeste opdrachten voor Mendix ontwikkelaars vereisen 3 jaar ervaring en minimaal een Advanced certificaat.\nAls freelancer heb je geen directe collega\u0026rsquo;s meer Als je werkt in loondienst via een detacheerder heb je vaak de detacheerder als \u0026rsquo;thuisbasis\u0026rsquo;. Je hebt dan altijd je directe collega\u0026rsquo;s om op terug te vallen met vragen. Dit valt als freelancer weg. Je bent afhankelijker van de opdracht en de mensen die daar rondlopen. Sommige bedrijven nemen freelancers mee in sociale bedrijfsactiviteiten, anderen hebben exclusieve activiteiten enkel voor werknemers.\nWel zoeken freelancers elkaar gauw op en zijn er altijd communities te vinden. In het geval van Mendix heb je bijvoorbeeld de Mendix Community op Slack, waar je in ieder geval buiten je opdracht contact kunt hebben met mensen in de gemeenschap.\nDe stap zetten De de eerste stap is altijd het aanvragen van een KvK-nummer. Een KvK-nummer is essentieel voor het starten als zelfstandige; je hebt hem voor bijna alles nodig. Voor mezelf heb ik tijdens het opstarten bijgehouden wat er verder allemaal bij kwam kijken. Het verschilt per persoon waar je prioriteiten liggen. Het is aan jou zelf om te onderzoeken wat je hiervan nodig acht.\nAdministratie KvK nummer aanvragen Zakelijke rekening openen Boekhoudprogramma uitkiezen Boekhouder aannemen Laptop bestellen Website maken CV updaten LinkedIn bijwerken Zakelijk e-mail adres aanmaken NS Zakelijk aanvragen Template overeenkomst van opdracht opstellen (OvO) Office 365 licentie Tankpas aanvragen Groothandel passen aanvragen Inschrijvingen verzekeringen Inschrijven ZZP Nederland of Ondernemerscollectief Arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering (AOV) Aansprakelijkheidsverzekering bedrijven (AVB) Beroepsaansprakelijkheidsverzekering (BAV) Overlijdensrisicoverzekering (ORV) Inschrijven ZZP marktplaatsen (freelance.nl, Headfirst, brainnet etc.) Omzetten naar zakelijke rekening: Telefoonabonnement Internet- en televisieabonnement Autoverzekering Wegenbelasting ANWB Belastingdienst standaard rekeningnummer ","permalink":"https://maismaus.github.io/blog/freelance-ervaringen-en-tips/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn september 2021 begon ik als freelancer.

However, there are many simple tricks that you can use in your day to day work that make your life a little bit easier. In this blog post, I will go over some of the pro tips that I have gathered during my time as a Mendix developer.\n1. Use dissolve container to quickly remove a container Got a container you don\u0026rsquo;t need anymore, but you need to save the content within it? Stop dragging all items out of the container before deleting it! Simply right click the container and select dissolve container to remove the container but keep the content contained within it.\n2. Use inline snippet to return snippet contents back to a page Similar to dissolve container, you can right click a snippet and select inline snippet to put all snippet contents back on a page instantly.\n3. Quickly set the return value in a microflow I used to select the entity to return from a microflow by:\nDouble clicking the End event Selecting the return Entity type Entering a variable to return However, you can also right click an activity that contains a variable and press Set as return value to do all of those things at once!\n4. Instantly swap input widget types for enumerations and booleans As you probably know, you can use different types of input widgets for enumerations and booleans. Enumeration attributes support drop down and radio button widgets, and booleans support radio buttons and checkboxes. Did you know you can right click those input widgets to instantly swap between the two types of input widgets?\n5. Dragging and dropping Drag and drop is a pattern which is used often throughout Studio Pro. Did you know you can use it in many more instances than you might be aware of?\nDrag flows from the Explorer into Microflows You can either drag a microflow into a blank area of a microflow to create a new Call Microflow activity, or onto an existing Call Microflow activity to replace the subflow call with another.\nDrag items from the Explorer into pages You can drag most items from the Project Explorer into a page to add a widget to your page instantly. You can drag them onto existing widgets or onto blank targets to create a new widget.\nSome examples of drag and drop actions that you can do:\nDrag a microflow onto a button to set that microflow as the button action Drag a page into a page view to insert a button linking to that page Drag a microflow onto a dataview to set that microflow as the datasource Microflows must return a list before you can drag them onto a listview, and they must return a single object before you can drag them onto a data view.\nDrag connector items into data views to insert input widgets If you have your selection inside a dataview, the connector tab will show you the attributes for the entity in that dataview. You can use the connector to drag any of those attributes into the dataview to instantly create an input widget for that attribute. No more scrolling through the Toolbox to find the correct widget, it automatically select the right type of input widget for that attribute!\n6. Keyboard shortcuts I\u0026rsquo;m sure you are using some of the shortcut keys that Mendix Studio Pro offers, but are you making full use of them? These are the shortcuts I use every single day:\nCtrl + Enter to close any window that you currently have open Ctrl + G to open the quick find menu Ctrl + Space to open the autofill option when entering a variable or XPath F5 to run your app F9 to view your app Ctrl + W to close any open tab Shift + mouse wheel scrolls through a microflow horizontally Refer to the Mendix documentation to view all shortcut keys configured for Studio Pro\n7. Use the custom caption option to improve legibility of your microflows When you call a submicroflow from another microflow, Mendix auto generates the caption that is displayed from the name of the submicroflow. However, you can greatly improve legibility by adding a custom caption to your submicroflow call. Just select the action and press Shift + F2 to enter a custom caption. This way, you can explain in your own language what the microflow is doing.\n8. Add custom design properties to your project In the appearance tab, you can assign design properties to apply to your page content. Selecting a design property adds the corresponding class to that element.\nDesign properties are defined in design-projecties.json in your project directory. You can add custom design properties to your project to allow all team members to easily discover available custom classes.\nFor instance, you can add the \u0026lsquo;hide empty\u0026rsquo; design property to all listviews by adding the code below to design-properties.json. From then on, you can select it as a design property in the appearance tab.\n\u0026#34;ListView\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hide empty\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Toggle\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hides the \u0026#39;no items found\u0026#39; in empty lists.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;class\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;listview-hide-empty\u0026#34; } ], Design properties do nothing besides adding a class to the element, so make sure you have appropriate styling available in your stylesheets to apply to the element!\n9. Align your microflows automatically In a recent release, Mendix added the option to align your microflow actions automatically. Just select the elements that you want to align, and right click to select the correct option. For instance, distribute horizontally automatically adds the same space between all selected actions.\nFrom this: To this! More useful when you have more than a single action, obviously.\n10. Use the documentation export to quickly generate app documentation As you are probably aware, Mendix allows you to document content of your app in most places. You can add documentation to domain models, entities, microflows, and even separate microflow parameters. But did you know there is a built-in export feature for these types of documentation files? Just right click your app in the Explorer and select \u0026lsquo;Export documentation\u0026rsquo;. This automatically generates a comprehensive .html file with all your project documentation!\nI hope these tips will help you become a true Mendix Pro. If you have any thoughts, feel free to share them.

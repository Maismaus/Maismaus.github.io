Have you ever wondered how much of a difference in performance a better laptop makes? Have you ever wondered what aspects of a laptop you should focus on when looking for the best PC for building Mendix applications?

Introducing the **Mendix Hardware Survey**! After this survey, I hope to answer the commonly asked question on purchasing a Mendix development machine.

# How to participate

1. Download the [.mpk package](https://we.tl/t-WZp96ALFa6).
2. Extract the package and open the .mpr file.
3. Run the project locally.
   * Start a timer when pressing the run button.
   * Stop the timer when the "Your app is running!" message appears.
   * Note the time in the included [Excel sheet](/StudioProBenchmark.xlsx) under Benchmark 1.

4. Press the Run benchmark button and wait for it to finish.
5. Note your results in the Benchmarks tab of the [Excel sheet](/StudioProBenchmark.xlsx).

Repeat step 3 - 5 as often as you'd like, then send me the results through Slack, LinkedIn, or mail: [mendixhardwaresurvey.visible078@passfwd.com](mailto:mendixhardwaresurvey.visible078@passfwd.com).
